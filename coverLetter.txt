ConsensYs Hiring Team,

I am a passionate Full Stack Software Engineer with extensive experience in microservices architecture and modern web technologies, currently interested in transitioning my career toward blockchain and Web3 development.

Over the past three years, I've designed and developed scalable microservices architectures, standardized APIs across various applications, and built sophisticated frontend solutions using React and Vue. There are three things that make me the a really good fit for this position:

First, I have dabbled with blockchain in the past quite a lot, despite never getting to work on it professionally, I have never stopped watching closely and developing side weekend projects with web3 in mind. I have developed from your average crypto trading bot with simple moving averages to simple working DAOs in the ethereum test net. I have also always been interested in working in fintech so the idea of working with credit cards, crypto, blockchain and full stack just sounds like a perfect fit. 

Second, I bring versatile full-stack capabilities with experience across multiple technologies. I've developed lots of frontends using React, while also implementing complex backend systems using Node and express. I've built custom documentation engines using OpenAPI and SwaggerUI, and eventhough I haven't professionally worked with react native, I do have experiencie with mobile app development with Android Studio and I even dabbled in some basic React Native apps. This technical versatility allows me to adapt quickly to mobile development and blockchain-specific requirements.

Finally, I'm excited about ConsensYs' mission to build the infrastructure for the decentralized web. As someone passionate about Web3, fintech, and algorithmic trading, I recognize the transformative potential of blockchain technology. I'm eager for the opportunity to help one of the leading blockchain infrastructure companies continue to innovate and scale. I genuenly believe blockchain is the future and the idea of bringing crypto to the masses is thrilling to say the least!

I think you'll find that my experience is an excellent fit for ConsensYs and specifically this position. I'm ready to take my blockchain skills to the next level with your team and look forward to hearing back.

Sincerely,
Oscar Riquelme
